# Mechanical Component Performance Study

This project involves the analysis of stress and strain data obtained from simulations using ANSYS and SolidWorks. The goal is to identify performance patterns, potential failure zones, and insights to optimize mechanical design.

## 🔧 Tools & Technologies Used
- ANSYS (Simulation)
- SolidWorks (Modeling)
- Python (Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn)
- Excel
- Power BI (Optional Visualization)

## 📁 Project Structure
- `/data` - Contains sample stress-strain data
- `/scripts` - Python scripts for data analysis
- `/images` - Placeholder for simulation plots or design visuals
- `/reports` - Optional PDF or PPT report
